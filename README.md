# Spectrogram-VisionTransformer

A project that applies Vision Transformer (ViT) architectures to **spectrograms** for audio / speech tasks (e.g. classification, recognition).  
Transforms audio signals into spectrogram “images” and uses transformer models to learn from them.

## Introduction

Deep learning for audio often uses convolutional networks on spectrogram inputs.  
This project explores using Vision Transformers (ViT) on spectrograms to capture global patterns and long-range dependencies in time-frequency space.  

The key idea:  
1. Convert a raw audio waveform → spectrogram (e.g. Mel spectrogram)  
2. Treat the spectrogram as a 2D image  
3. Feed patches / tokens into a Transformer / ViT model  
4. Train / fine-tune for audio tasks (classification, detection, etc.)

## Features

- Pipeline for audio → spectrogram → transformer input  
- Preprocessing scripts (e.g. STFT, Mel, normalization)  
- Model architectures based on ViT / Transformer  
- Training and evaluation scripts  
- Support for GPU / multi-GPU  
- Logging, checkpoints, and result saving  

## Installation

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/Sree14hari/Spectrogram-VisionTransformer.git
cd Spectrogram-VisionTransformer

# (Optional) create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate   # or venv\Scripts\activate on Windows

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

You’ll need packages like `torch`, `numpy`, `librosa` (or similar for spectrograms), etc.

## Usage

### Prepare data

* Place your audio files / dataset in a folder
* (Optional) a config or script to convert them into spectrograms

### Train a model

```bash
python train.py --config configs/your_config.yaml
```

### Evaluate or infer

```bash
python evaluate.py --checkpoint path/to/model.pth --data your_test_data
```

### Example script

You could include a sample script `run_demo.py` that loads a sample audio, converts to spectrogram, runs through the model, and prints results.

## Model / Architecture

Describe the architecture you used:

* Patch size (e.g. 16×16)
* Number of transformer layers / heads / embedding dimension
* Any modifications you did for spectrogram data (positional embeddings, time-frequency embedding, masking, etc.)
* Loss functions, regularization, etc.

If you adopted or adapted from other works (e.g. `ASiT: Audio Spectrogram vIsion Transformer` ([arXiv][1]) or other similar works), mention it here.
